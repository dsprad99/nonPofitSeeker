		This website is built off of a program that retrieves the most recent tax filings for various
		non-profits, assigns each non-profit a "score" based on factors such as director compensation
		and operations expenses, and organizes them all into a table.
		<br>
		<br>
		Users can access the table by clicking the "search" bookmark at the top of this page.
		The table automatically sorts by name, but users can filter by the location, revenue,
		and expenses (among other criteria) of each non-profit.
		<br>
		<br>
		This website was developed by Davis Spradling and Derek Stephens.
		<br>

		Data collected from Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Series 990 Filings. Download them yourself
