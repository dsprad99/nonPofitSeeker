		<h1 id="header">Our Mission</h1>
		There are over 1.5 million non-profits in the United States. As an
		average person, it can often be difficult deciding which ones are
		worthwile contributing to. Which non-profits are spending their money wisely?
		Which ones do the most good for society?
		<br>
		<br>
		We want to provide people with the information they need to make
		informed choices about non-profits around the United States. Everybody
		needs to know whether or not their time or money will be wasted if they
		choose to make a contribution.
