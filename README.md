# nonPofitSeeker
Non Profit seeker is an award winning Hack@Davidson Hackathon website that allows users to look up non profits and see statistics about the non profit
such as how much they pay management, amount given to actually help fund there cause, and expenses that the non profit has. With this information
from the IRS Form 990 which can be found on the IRS website in a CSV file we were able to take a sample of about 50 non profits. With this data we
were able to come up with an algorithm that gives a rating for each non profit and displays it next to each non profit that is searched on our website. The 
alorithm we used ((payment to management and directors/expense+contributions+payment to directors)*log(total)). This was the most apporpriate and well 
balanced formula we felt for the task at hand. This project did end up coming in first place for tech for best use.
