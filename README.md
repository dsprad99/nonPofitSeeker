# nonPofitSeeker
Nonprofit Seeker is an award winning project at the Hack@Davidson event in Davidson, North Carolina. This project won the award of technology for best use. The idea behind Nonprofit Seeker was to allow users to easily be able to identify what nonprofits are contributing there money towards the actual cause they support. The information that we gathered was from a Form 990 which is required for larger nonprofits organizations with gross receipts over $200,000 or total assets over $500,000. Form 990 requires a significant amount of detail about the organization's activities, governance, finances, and compensation of its officers, directors, and key employees. Overall it is very difficult to break down as there are over 200 columns of different kinds of data such as compensation, revenue, and payments to directors and non qualified members. Our goal was to make this data easy to read so that a user could easily identify where money in these nonprofits is going. With that we created a rating algoirthm that rates nonprofits based on a logarithm formula that our team came up with and felt was very accurate.
